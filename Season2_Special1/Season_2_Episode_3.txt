Xiao Yan, who had entered the inner parts of the Magical Beast Mountain Range,
was diligently training.
But then, the appearance of Yun Zhi
caused Xiao Yan to feel a ripple in his heart.
Spending time together,
their feelings for one another deepened day by day.
Faced with the Amethyst Winged Lion King's pursuit,
Xiao Yan stepped forward for Yun Zhi's sake,
doing all that he could,
and then fell, injured, into a coma.
Feels good, man...
hm?
Where is this place?
That purple flame...
my body...
Sea Core Vest?
This... is still warm.
Yun Zhi? Yun Zhi!
Yun Zhi!
Gone already?
She actually left behind a close-fitting thing...
It's better she goes back to being that highly respected Dou Huang.
Thinking about a girl?
Need your teacher to help find and bring her back?
Sure!
Sure, my ass!
That person is a formidable Dou Huang,
would she really appear just because you look for her?
Leaving behind these precious things,
already shows she has a high opinion of you.
This is Yun Zhi's close-fitting protective soft armor,
Kid,
did you think that girl only gave you a piece of armor?
Looks like you haven't noticed the even bigger gifts yet.
I know,
there's also a Dou Technique scroll.
Even bigger than that!
Try checking your strength level.
How?
How did I reach nine stars?
How about it?
Like I said, this is an even bigger gift, right?
Teacher,
stop beating around the bush.
Tell me,
was it that Yun Zhi-
Last night was exceptionally dangerous.
At first, I thought that girl would just leave you behind.
I was just about to come out and save you,
but, to my surprise,
that girl actually risked her own safety
to help heal your wounds.
Using this method,
she gently poured her Dou Qi
into your body,
and redirected the purple flame.
Yao Yan,
you have shown kindness to me.
I definitely won't abandon you now that you are hurt.
So it was.
That girl helped you tame the purple flame;
not only did this heal your wounds,
but it also greatly increased your strength.
Yao Yan,
I'm leaving now.
Until we meet again.
Yun Zhi...
Xuan Rank Dou Technique,
Exploding Steps.
Not too shabby.
Although you just jumped two levels,
already reaching nine stars,
your foundation isn't firm.
You must train even harder,
in order to be able to defeat Mu She.
Where'd you go?
Teacher!
Stop prattling and quickly teach me Exploding Steps!
Stinky brat,
even more impatient than I am!
Teacher,
please teach me Exploding Steps now.
Good,
you have ambition.
Watch closely.
Exploding Steps!
Octane Blast!
Ha ha ha!
This Exploding Steps,
paired with Octane Blast,
plus your nine star strength
will definitely make for an explosive combo in close combat.
Yun Zhi,
thank you.
Thanking me?
We're on close terms,
no need to thank.
That woman already refined the Amethyst Essence in your body once,
however,
if you were to allow the purple flame to increase your strength,
the Qi Vortex inside your body would swell and burst. 
Amethyst Winged Lions are able to directly advance by a whole rank
because their physical bodies are very tough,
so they don't need to worry about backlash from the purple flame.
As for you,
if you just relied on the purple flame to become a Dou Shi,
I'm afraid, you would have long been turned into a pile of ashes.
All that being said,
this essence turns out to be a poison?
Don't worry.
Over the next month,
you must hunt at least five Rank 1 Magical Beasts everyday.
Only through fighting,
can you stabilize the violent Dou Qi inside your body.
Otherwise,
when you encounter a Heavenly Flame in the future,
you can forget about being able to swallow it.
Five heads then, so be it,
even ten heads is no biggie!
Speak less nonsense,
hurry up!
Yes,
Teacher.
Mu She,
you forced me into the depths of the Magical Beast Mountain Range.
Now,
it's time for me to get back at you.
Ka Gang, Ka Gang,
I can't run any longer!
Ling Er,
you can't stop!
We can't let our spoils fall into the hands of those Wolf Head thieves!
No, no,
I really can't take it...
Jia! Jia! Jia!
Not good!
They're chasing us!
Run!
Ling Er! Ling Er,
keep it together!
Ka Gang,
don't mind me.
Take away the spoils
and quickly rendezvous with Qing Ye!
Gan Mu!
You shameless bastard!
Come on if you dare!
I just heard you yell Gan Mu,
Who's there?
did you mean Wolf Head Mercenary Company's Gan Mu? 
Yes, precisely him!
Second Company Leader Gan Mu,
not only does he want to seize our spoils,
but also towards Ling Er, he...
What a coincidence, I was just trying to go find and play with him.
You are...?
I am Ka Gang from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company!
This is Ling Er.
Kid,
don't act all high and mighty,
like you can fight and go wherever you please!
The Wolf Head Mercenary Company isn't as simple as you think!
You too,
leave quickly!
Don't bother about me.
Jia! Jia! Jia!
Right about time. //They've come at just the right time.
Is there something wrong with that kid's brain?
Ka Gang,
why didn't you stop him?
He's going to get himself killed!
Let's just go together,
hopefully there's still a chance!
Okay.
Wait for me!
Jia! Jia! Jia!
Hurry up!
Snatch the spoils!
And that girl too!
Tonight I'm going to make her my little concubine, ha ha ha!
Jia! Jia! Jia!
Exploding Steps!
Trying to get away?
Vacuum Palm!
Strike!
Shit,
Who the hell
dares to make a fool out of me?
Are you that Gan Mu?
Little brat,
Gan Mu isn't a name for you to casually toss around.
Die!
This-
How?
Fierce Tiger Descent!
I underestimated him,
who knew he'd be so...
Go on, continue!
Stranger, spit out your name!
Your grandpa.
What?
I am called
your grandpa!
You are...
Xiao Yan?
You're actually still alive?
It is indeed I, your grandpa!
Xiao Yan?
The guy who has Wolf Head Mercenary Company in an uproar, Xiao Yan?
There is a way to Heaven,
there is no door to hell!
Today is the day you die!
Pay up your life!
Remember, Mr. Gan,
today is your day of reckoning!
It's time for you to die.
Little Fairy Doctor!
What did you say?
Little Fairy Doctor,
I know some news about her!
Mister Yao of the Thousand Medicine House
has long been scheming against Little Fairy Doctor.
He is an insidious person;
even our boss is quite fearful of him.
The way I see it, Mister Yao taking in Little Fairy Doctor,
definitely has some ulterior motives,
most likely, he's trying to get a hold of her Rainbow Poison Book.
In that case, isn't Little Fairy Doctor in danger?
Ling Er, watch out!
Little doll,
become my hostage!
What?
Exploding Steps!
Octane Blast!
 Are you okay?
Thank you, young hero.
Someday our Bloody Battle Mercenary Company will definitely-
This-
So handsome *o*
What was that?
Little Fairy Doctor,
I'm coming.
