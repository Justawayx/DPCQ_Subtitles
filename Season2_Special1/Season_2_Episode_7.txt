In order to find an important item for swallowing the Heavenly Flame,
Ice Spirit Cold Fountain,
Xiao Yan joined the Alchemist Association.
The next step
is to obtain the whereabouts of Ice Spirit Cold Fountain from the Association.
Whoever has exotic treasure,
want to sell it to me?
I will definitely give you a satisfactory price.
Little fellow,
Come, come, please sit down.
How is it?
This Alchemist's long robe fits you, yes?
My thanks to the two Grandmasters.
Truth be told,
this Ice Spirit Cold Fountain is very important to me.
Little fellow,
Ice Spirit Cold Fountain is but an extremely rare natural treasure.
With your current ability,
it seems you can't possibly have use for those kinds of things, right?
Early tomorrow, I will leave Black Rock City
to make a trip to the Empire's eastern border.
So while I'm here, I have to prepare all the things I need.
That thing is really very rare,
and it also has extremely strict preservation requirements.
I remember,
there was once a Tier 4 alchemist who, in a freezing cold place,
luckily found some Ice Spirit Cold Fountain,
but in the end, due to improper preservation
it actually turned into white mist.
Apologies,
I've checked all of Jia Ma Empire's internal transaction records
but could not find the Ice Cold Spirit Fountain.
Then, two Grandmasters,
do you know if someone in the Alchemist Association has ever possessed one?
I'm willing to pay a high price to exchange for it.
Is there really no one?
Ice Cold Spirit Fountain is a rarity whose value can't be measured in gold coins.
And even if someone has this thing,
it'd be very difficult to make them take it out for exchange.
Since it's not here,
then I will be taking my leave.
Wait!
Little fellow,
I really don't want you to have any association with that guy.
That guy?
Grandmaster Otto,
would you mind clarifying?
After entering,
be sure to carefully follow behind me.
Remember,
you must not upset him.
This fellow always likes to mess around with these shady things.
Let's go.
Don't touch anything.
That is the eye of Enchanting Magic Grass.
Looking at it will cause you to hallucinate.
Try not to look at that thing.
Little fellow,
we have arrived.
Old bastard.
Instead of learning proper medicine refinement-
What nonsense about proper medicine refinement,
in what ways are these things of mine not proper?
You old rascal,
don't think that just because you're the Alchemist Association's Vice Chairman,
I won't dare to touch you!
You are the old rascal!
Old fellow,
after you broke my door with a kick last time,
I specially changed it to a steel door.
What strong Dou Qi,
his strength should at least be at the Dou Ling class.
Old bastard,
you've really done it!
Xiao Yan, come in.
Fire Heart Seven Leaf Flower,
Blood Crystal Grass,
Blue Heart Rock
The collection here is almost too rich...
Old rascal,
you brought someone else here?
Brat,
don't you dare have thoughts about my treasures!
Apologies, Grandmaster.
In all my life,
I've never seen so many rare treasures.
Perhaps, in the entire Jia Ma Empire,
there isn't anyone who can compare to you.
Brat, you sure know how to talk.
However, what you said is quite true.
If there's nothing else, quickly get out!
I am very busy.
Old fellow,
last time you told me
you traded for a bottle of Ice Spirit Cold Fountain from someone else
Scram!
You old bastard,
don't ever come here again!
His name is Gu Te,
as for how to make him exchange the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain,
it'll all depend on yourself.
This individual is my honored guest.
If anything happens to him,
believe it, one day I'll have everything in your treasure room be written down and announced to the public!
Old fellow,
Look at you painting me in such a way.
This little fellow,
I liked him at first glance,
how could things be like what you said?
What were you doing earlier.
Old bastard,
just you wait!
Brat,
shall I send you out,
or will you leave yourself?
Grandmaster Gu Te,
I believe that in this world, there are no impossible transactions.
What can a little boy like you take out to exchange?
Laughable.
Laughable, laughable, laughable.
In that case,
if I were to offer something that really tempts you,
you would be willing to take out the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain, yes?
Don't try to be clever with me.
I certainly won't fall for it.
Won't fall for it, won't fall for it, won't fall for it!
Is that so?
Then, what do you think about this?
This...
this is...
this is, this is, this is...
This is
a good thing.
Here I thought you knew what it was.
Amethyst Birth Essence!
Kid,
I couldn't imagine
you could actually get a hold of a rare item like Amethyst Birth Essence.
Little brother,
I still don't know your name...
Xiao Yan.
Little brother Xiao Yan,
that is, that is,
since you're searching for Ice Spirit Cold Fountain,
well, the magnitude of its rarity
is something you should be clear on, yes?
If I didn't know,
why would I take out such a unique thing like Amethyst Birth Essence?
Let me put it this way,
your Amethyst Birth Essence is indeed also considered a rare item.
However, you should be clear
that this thing is only useful for people who practice fire type Qi Methods.
This limits its value, you know?
Grandmaster Gu Te,
you also shouldn't take me for a fool.
Both of us know,
as for the Amethyst Birth Essence,
just what kind of huge effect it has on fire type Qi Method practitioners.
Many alchemists,
in order to obtain it,
would not even hesitate to give up everything they own.
How great its value is,
you should be the clearest about.
I only have one bottle of this Amethyst Birth Essence.
If you exchange, great; if you don't, so be it.
I am only able to take out this thing.
Out of everything on my body, it is the most valuable.
If you still think the quantity is insufficient,
even though I really need the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain,
then I'll have no choice but to give up.
Since it's like this,
then I'll have no choice but to regretfully tell you
this transaction... has failed.
Then I've bothered Grandmaster.
This is the last day I'm staying in Black Rock City.
Tomorrow, I will be leaving the Jia Ma Empire.
May we have the opportunity to exchange in the future.
Want, don't want, want, don't want, want, don't want...
This old bastard's mental fortitude is too strong,
could it be that Amethyst Birth Essence really doesn't pose enough attraction to him?
Looks like my supply of Amethyst Birth Essence is about to shrink again...
Brat,
you... you win.
My whole life,
I've never seen Amethyst Birth Essence.
Therefore,
you are very lucky.
Grandmaster Gu Te,
thank you for your agreement.
Back then I heard some bastard talk about this Amethyst Birth Essence,
but I've never seen it with my own eyes.
Today is a lucky day.
Grandmaster Gu Te,
could you take out the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain for me to see?
Why the hurry?
The Ice Spirit Cold Fountain you want,
go ahead and take it.
Take it, take it!
Yes, that's it.
Looks like this old fellow does have some credibility.
This Ice Spirit Cold Fountain,
as expected of a rare and exotic treasure.
No wonder, when swallowing a Heavenly Flame,
one must have this thing for assistance.
Don't let me see it again!
If that's all then leave!
Leave, leave, leave!
"Flying Transportation [Company]" // 飞行运输行
Suddenly I'm a little envious of Little Fairy Doctor,
having a flying mount is really too convenient.
Alright, in the future I must also get a flying pet!
Sir, sir!
Get lost!
Sir, I am very sorry,
please forgive this little one this once...
You blind fellow,
Teacher is but a genuine Tier 3 Alchemist!
If his elderly self were to get hurt, could you afford it?
First apologize
Yes, yes
What if he were to get hurt
Exactly
Lick it.
This-
Blocking my way,
dirtying the foot I used to kick you!
Teacher,
that's him!
Little fellow, not bad!
You were even able to handle Gu Te, that old fellow!
Grandmaster Otto.
Xiao Yan, you're so slow!
I heard you're leaving,
will you ever come back then?
This girl,
what is her problem? //吹得哪门子邪风 idk what this means
This is the Rank 3 Monster Core you wanted.
Many thanks for Grandmaster Frank's gift.
It's a trifling matter.
Little fellow,
in half a year's time, the capital city will host an Alchemist Grand Meeting.
Are you interested in participating?
Alchemist Grand Meeting?
This is a grand event in Jia Ma Empire's alchemist scene.
Even some alchemists from other empires in the continent 
will come and join the fun.
Missing it would be a pity.
Ok!
If I'm available at that time,
I'll definitely come take a look.
We've forgotten the main business!
Little fellow, what are you queueing here for?
According to the Empire's policies,
alchemists can fly and receive special service for free.
Come.
Then Xiao Yan won't stay for much longer.
Thank you for your kindness.
Till we meet again.
Xiao Yan, you have to come back!
Special service...
here,
the status of an alchemist really is something...
Teacher, it's him!
