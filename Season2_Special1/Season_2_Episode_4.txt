Gan Mu's death
placed a great pressure on the Wolf Head Mercenary Company.
Without killing Xiao Yan,
the Mu family's rage could not be pacified.
At this moment,
Xiao Yan, under cover of night,
was rushing over.
I heard that Gan Mu has been killed by some unknown youth.
They say that the kid has a terrifying huge ruler.
Really?
Yup. // sketch
It's me.
Xiao Yan!
My goodness,
I thought you...
don't you know how worried I've-
It isn't safe here.
Pack your things and leave with me immediately.
What's wrong?
If I just left with you like that,
once the Wolf Head Mercenary Company finds out,
they're bound to go on a crazy manhunt
and take advantage of the opportunity to harm innocent people.
En,
I've always wanted to get rid of that bunch of scourges.
I was just worried about you,
so I came to rescue you first.
You're that worried about me?
Of course,
we're friends, right?
Come,
Xiao Yan, don't hurry,
have a sip of tea.
Let's discuss
and plan out how to deal with them.
Transmit the order,
perform a comprehensive search for any traces of Xiao Yan!
This time,
he cannot be allowed to escape!
Capture Xiao Yan,
kill without mercy!
Yea! Yea!
Little Fairy Doctor,
looks like you have a guest,
why didn't you let me know earlier?
This is...?
This is my brother.
I didn't know you had a brother.
Young brother, visiting the Thousand Medicine House at such a late time,
what might you be trying to do?
Tonight, I'm going to bring Little Fairy Doctor out of this place.
What is it, Little Fairy Doctor,
are you unable to get used to living in my Thousand Medicine House?
Of course not,
Mister Yao's care has been very attentive,
how could I not enjoy living here?
Then this is...
It's just that I have something important to do,
so I need to leave first.
Here's a small bit of money
to show my gratitude for Mister Yao's care.
Could it be that you don't know
what I really want from you as repayment?
Right,
this brother of yours,
should be Xiao Yan, yes?
If the Wolf Head Mercenary Company were to find out you're here...
Enough!
What do you want?
Stop playing dumb.
Rainbow Poison Book,
hand it over!
Mister Yao,
aren't you making things difficult for me?
Where do I have this Rainbow Poison Book?
Today, if you don't take out the Rainbow Poison Book,
then leave your life behind.
Right,
we'll have this brother Xiao Yan
also leave behind his life!
Bunch of weaklings.
Come at me, then.
Heavy black ruler?
Don't duck, what are you scared of?
Youngsters,
don't think that just because you have some ability, you can act wildly in my Thousand Medicine House.
I'll have you know,
right when I entered the room,
I already laid down highly toxic poison.
Xiao Yan,
aren't you feeling weak all over right now?
Reporting to the Company Leader.
We've discovered Xiao Yan's whereabouts.
Where is he?
At the Thousand Medicine House!
What?
How many people did he bring?
It's- it's just him alone...
Alone?
You're sure it's just him alone? One person?
Abs-absolutely certain!
Order!
Head to Thousand Medicine House with the utmost speed!
Yes!
Mister Yao's poisoning abilities,
why wouldn't I know about them?
It's just that your poison,
I've already broken it.
What?
Earlier, I put antidote in the teapot.
Let's discuss and plan out how to deal with them.
As for you, Mister Yao,
afraid of getting poisoned by me,
all these days
you've never dared to come within three feet of me.
Entering my room today,
aren't you being somewhat careless?
My chair isn't something you can casually sit in.
Only inspecting the chair now,
isn't it a bit too late?
You!
My poison,
once it goes into effect,
you'll experience pain for seven days and seven nights,
then your muscles and bones will fall apart,
and you'll die for lack of breath.
Stop fretting,
only my antidote will work.
Th-the antidote, where is it?
The antidote...
there might be a little left in the teapot!
It's all gone,
how about
you come back tomorrow for tea?
Aren't you feeling weak all over right now?
Little Fairy Doctor,
on account of us working in the same business,
allow me to live, I beg of you!
Please allow me to live!
Let us leave,
then I'll give the antidote to you.
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Withdraw    Go outside    Go, go, go
Thanks a bunch.
Xiao Yan,
let's head out!
Little Fairy Doctor,
to think you would have so many clever ideas.
I, Xiao Yan, could never learn to be like that.
Silly,
a woman's heart is as unfathomable
as a needle at the bottom of the sea.
Let's go!
Little Lan!
Antidote! The antidote!

Stop hurting people.
Many thanks, many thanks!
Company Leader Mu She,
long time no see.
It's Xiao Yan!
Sorry,
I'm here to play.
Good kid,
you have guts!
Mu She,
been a while since we last met,
yet you still like to put on airs while hiding in the back.
Ha, this is called strategizing!
Perhaps the one who came up with this bad idea
is that bastard son standing behind you?
Kill him!
Kill!
Xiao Yan,
jump aside!
Xiao Yan,
keep your guard up!
Don't worry,
let me handle this!
Xiao Yan,
just because you have a helper,
don't think that I'll be scared of you!

Let me see how you'll break my Dou Qi cloak!
Cut the crap.
Bring it on!
Take this!
Phoenix Soaring Steps!
Exploding Steps!
Piercing Gust!
No matter what happens today,
you must die here!
These words,
didn't you say the same thing last time?
What kind of bizarre thing is this?
So damn heavy!
This ruler isn't fun to play with, huh?
It's alright.
Flame Blowing Palm!
Vacuum Palm!
You-
Exploding Steps!
Octane Blast!
Shit,
there's a hidden force!
Explode!
How could a mere Dou Zhe
have such high level Dou Techniques?
In that case, I'll let you experience
my newly practiced skill!
Thanks to you and Little Fairy Doctor,
the third stone box in that cave
just so happened to have a suitable high level Dou Technique for me.
Today,
I'll let you die to this skill!
I didn't expect
that this old fellow would take the risk of forcefully opening the stone box.
Today's fight,
I can't continue to hold anything back.
Student, you must remember,
attack only if you have enough Qi,
don't accidentally harm yourself.
Yes, Teacher!
Wild Lion Chant!
Flame Splitting Tsunami!
Xiao Yan.
Xiao- Yan-
Xiao Yan, are you okay?
You're bleeding!
I'm fine, I'm fine.
As long as you're safe, I'm happy.
Watch out!
Xiao Yan!
Xiao Yan, Xiao Yan!
That really scared me,
I thought you...
Don't worry,
I have this to protect me.
Xiao Yan,
you're too amazing.
But your injuries aren't trivial,
how about I bring you somewhere to recuperate in peace for a while?
Sure,
Little Fairy Doctor!
Such a beautiful and precious piece of soft armor,
which girl gave it to you?
This- this...
