Blood Lotus Pill,
a Tier 5 medicinal pill,
is the last item Xiao Yan needs in preparation to swallow a Heavenly Flame.
Whenever a pill higher than Tier 4 forms,
strange phenomena will occur.
This poses a fatal attraction to many people.
Some people would even risk their life
in trying to obtain the pill.
This Tager Desert sure is far.
It's already been two days since we left Black Rock City.
Right, Teacher
the Blood Lotus Pill's ingredients have already been gathered,
since it's a long journey...
What,
do you want to refine the Blood Lotus Pill now?
Let's prepare ahead of time.
Didn't Teacher also say back then,
if we're lucky,
who knows just when we'll suddenly encounter a Heavenly Flame?
This Blood Lotus Pill can rank among the Tier 5 medicinal pills.
Refining it will indeed take some time.
Tier 5 medicinal pill?
Across the entire Jia Ma Empire,
perhaps only Pill-King Gu He would be able to refine it!
What are you waiting for?
Let's hurry.
Yes, alright!
The service here is really not bad.
How about I help you pick a few better-looking ones,
for a change of taste?
It's those fellows again.
Please, please.
Observing how to refine a high tier pill from a close distance
will be very beneficial to you.
Yes, Teacher.
Learn well.
Teacher, with the help of a Heavenly Flame,
has already spent a whole two and a half days.
If normal alchemists
wanted to successfully refine this Blood Lotus Pill,
I reckon, without a good ten days
it'd definitely be impossible.
The pill is about to be formed.
En.
Guard the door.
Give me a few minutes to complete the pill without disturbance.
Little brother Xiao Yan,
we meet again.
The youngest Tier 2 alchemist Xiao Yan,
have you forgotten about us so quickly?
You guys are like ghosts who won't go away.
You were running pretty quick when you boarded the ship.
I heard,
from that old fellow Gu Te's hands,
you were able to obtain some amazing thing.
That whatever thing
isn't important.
That's right.
Little brother,
just then an energy ripple suddenly appeared,
might it have originated from here?
Given that everyone is a thousand meters high in the sky,
if anything were to happen,
we would all have to suffer.
Exactly.
This little brother,
everyone is on the same boat right now.
Please take out those dangerous things for us to keepsafe.
Otherwise,
it won't be good for any of us.
That's right, that's right.
You all are sensible people,
there's no need to play dumb with me.
What my teacher is currently doing inside won't affect the flight.
Please, if you all could give some face
and stop making a random disturbance.
Or else...
Little brother,
we would simply like to take a look,
there won't be any trouble.
Please move aside!
Octane Blast!
Crap!
I heard,
you wanted to finish me off?
Sir,
no, no, no
We- we did not have any intentions of offending you.
We only... wanted to ensure our safety, that's all.
What you all want... is this?
Sir, you're joking,
how can we dare to mess with you.
You weren't saying that a moment ago.
A moment ago- a moment ago we were just joking!
Originally, I did not wish to kill.
However, you seek your own death,
so forget it.
This is the might of a Heavenly Flame?
That was a genuine Da Dou Shi.
Heavenly Flame...
No wonder so many people would desperately fight to obtain it.
This kind of power,
is really too enticing.
Kid,
this is our last chance.
You mean,
use Xiao Yan as a hostage!
You- you will also die here,
there's no way you can run!
He- won't spare you!
Sir, I am willing to follow you,
I just beg of you to let me live!
You can decide how to handle this person.
I don't need this kind of follower.
A kind person's heart must change for different people.
The world is filled with evil, man's heart is unpredictable.
If you don't acquire this resolve earlier,
when you get betrayed in the future,
think for yourself about the consequences.
Yet another Demon Lizard.
Magical Beasts are indeed savage,
but compared to the insidiousness of human nature
frankly, it's not worth mentioning.
That's true.
So,
one must decisively break things that are broken.
From this battle,
you really have matured quite a bit.
Promptly seeing through people's evil intentions.
Later, when facing desperate situations, don't expose your back to people you don't trust.
Who knows, you might end up like that alchemist
with a dagger out of nowhere piercing your chest.
Only with absolute strength
can you avoid twisting your own humanity for the sake of survival.
The final training place,
Tager Desert,
I'm finally about to arrive.
Yun Zhi? It's Yun Zhi?
Yun Zhi!
Yun Zhi!
Yun Zhi,
why are you also here-
Nalan Yanran?
Had a nightmare?
What you were just shouting was Nalan Yanran's name.
Teacher,
if I were to be defeated in the three year agreement,
the losses would not only include my own dignity
but more importantly, the clan's future.
I-
You are worried
that Nalan Yanran will be stronger than you?
Have you ever considered
This world does not have any truly strong people;
what it has, are only people who want to be strong.
If you really want to swing out your blade,
you need to let go of what's on your mind.
I reckon, swinging the sword and focusing on a task are the same
in that you should put down all misgivings in your heart.
I believe my sight won't be led astray.
Although your talent isn't bad,
it is, rather, your sacrifice
that is key to final success.
I greatly look forward to the Three Year Agreement in a few months' time.
Back then, she gave you a shame that was difficult to erase.
Now,
you already possess the qualification to take things back.
Many thanks for Teacher's advice.
En.
It really is a building.
Almost thought I'd seen a mirage.
Good opportunity
to buy a map of the Tager Desert
and prepare an ample water supply.
While you're at it,
see if you can find snake repellant.
There are snakes in this desert?
In the Tager Desert are a few Snake People tribes.
Although they cannot be considered very strong,
what they specialize in is using poisonous snakes to attack.
Better to be safe than sorry.
Old sir?
I'm here to buy maps.
If sir is busy,
I'll go ahead and browse on my own.
This-
Purifying Lotus Demon Flame?!
This fellow is really lucky,
actually finding a map piece we had zero clues about in a place like this.
Look like you and the Purifying Lotus Demon Flame
might be tied together by fate.
You are looking to purchase a map of the Tager Desert, aren't you.
Old sir,
could you give me the most precise and detailed map of the desert?
The maps are on the counter,
take your pick.
Old sir,
might you have other map fragments like this one here?
You've seen this kind of map fragment before?
It's just that I once encountered a similar one at an auction.
There aren't any others.
This is also just something I obtained by chance.
Then can old sir tell me,
where did you obtain it?
I dug it out in the desert.
Old sir,
can you sell this map fragment to me?
I'm willing to offer a high price.
Not selling.
Stop having intentions on the map fragment.
I don't desire money.
Also,
don't think about committing robbery,
it won't benefit you.
Indeed,
in front of a practitioner who may have once been a Dou Huang,
I really wouldn't be able to steal it.
