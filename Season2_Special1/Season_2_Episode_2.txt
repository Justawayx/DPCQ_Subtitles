On the Dou Qi Continent,

the outcome of a fight to the death

not only depends on each person's power level,

but is even more closely dependent on the Dou Techniques they practice.

Dou Techniques are split into four ranks, 

from highest to lowest: Tian, Di, Xuan, and Huang.

Even if one's power level is at a disadvantage,

as long as one's Dou Techniques are of slightly higher rank,

there remains hope in challenging the strong.

H-how could it be?

May I ask, Third Company Leader,

how does one burst apart, exactly?

Go die!

It's over, Third Company Leader.

What?

Octane Blast!

Kid, looks like you've improved,

your recent training in the Magical Beast Mountain Range hasn't been in vain.

Yes,

Teacher!

Like I already said,

with your power level,

there's no way you can break my d-defense!

Oh? That's not necessarily true.

Explode!

Even He Meng was killed.

Who did this?!

It-it was Xiao Yan!

I want to smash that little bastard's corpse into a thousand pieces!

Listen up!

Starting from tomorrow,

all those with strength above Five-star Fight Practitioner

must enter the Magical Beast Mountain Range!

After finding any traces of Xiao Yan,

immediately use bamboo whistles to alert!

Yes!

Little bastard,

your brazen days are coming to an end!

[written on the paper]
"Wolf Head's Third Company Leader He Meng has been killed.
The culprit is Xiao Yan."

Xiao Yan, that fellow,

has actually begun to take revenge.

It's only been a month,

but to be able to kill He Meng,

he should at least be an 8 star Dou Zhe now, right?

Xiao Yan,

you really are a genius.

Who is it?

Miss, Mister Yao wants to see you.

Mister Yao, please come in.

Miss Little Fairy Doctor, have you been doing well lately?

Of course, I've been well.

Might there be some reason why Mister Yao is looking for me?

Perhaps you've also heard of that youngster by the name of Xiao Yan.

Speaking of,

when you entered the cave to hunt for treasure,

he was with you, right?

Mister Yao,

I think you may be mistaken.

Xiao Yan and I only happened to meet by chance.

Because I fell onto a cliff while picking herbs,

I was fortunate to be saved by him once; nothing more.

Regarding that cave treasure hunt,

apologies,

we really did not find any treasure.

However, I did hear that

while we were being escorted back,

Wolf Head Mercenary Company members suddenly left the group.

Perhaps they were able to find something.

Is that true?

Absolutely.

If Mister Yao might be interested in that treasure,

why don't you try getting the other two mercenary group leaders

to check out what the Wolf Head Mercenary Company brought back?

Ha ha, I was just asking randomly.

Well then, I won't bother you any longer.

Xiao Yan,

where are you?

Xiao Yan,

Teacher,

You understand that your enemies in the future will be much stronger, yes?

Student understands.

Good. Hand your Heavy Xuan Ruler to me.

Here.

This must be what a real strong person looks like.

Di Rank Dou Technique, Flame Splitting Tsunami!

This is the power of a Di Rank Dou Technique?

Flame Splitting Tsunami.

Low Di Rank Dou Technique.

Practiced to perfection,

it can level mountains and sunder waves,

with every move.

Teacher,

such a strong skill,

why were you only willing to teach it to me now?

Remember,

with your current strength, you can only use this skill once.

If you were to forcefully use it a second time,

you would suffer extremely severe internal injuries.

At that point,

it could even affect your future potential.

So,

unless there is a crucial moment,

do not use it carelessly.

Thank you, Teacher.

Quick, surround him!

Looks like I've really underestimated you guys.

Xiao Yan,

we meet again.

Scrub,

what else do you want to play at?

As long as you hand over the key to the treasure fair and square,

maybe,

I can get my father to spare your little life!

Your father?

What is he, another scrub?

Boy doesn't know how to appreciate kindness.

Shoot!

Shit.

Vacuum Palm!

Xiao Yan is carrying a Xuan Rank Qi Method!

Whoever kills him,

will receive the Qi Method!

Kill Xiao Yan! Kill Xiao Yan!

What a nasty son of a bitch.

Come.

This little uncle will take time to play with y'all.

Looks like I can only use...

Xiao Yan!

The game is over!

Father,

this time Xiao Yan can't easily get away.

Even the scrub's father has come,

looks like the entire Wolf Head Mercenary Company is here.

Brat,

surrender the goods and I'll let you die a quick death!

Come and get it then.

Little bastard,

hand over your life!

Phoenix Soaring Steps!

This guy has a large and strong build,

yet his speed is this shocking!

Brat, go and die!

Heavy Xuan Ruler!

Kill him!

Avenge the Third Master!

Kill him!

Avenge the Third Master!

Kill him!

Avenge the Third Master!

Kid,

let's end this.

Flame Blowing Palm!

Remember,

with your current strength, you can only use this skill once.

If you were to forcefully use it a second time,

you would suffer extremely severe internal injuries.

Little brat,

still trying to struggle before your death!

Flame Splitting Tsunami!

Then let me show you the might of a Dou Shi!

Dancing Wind Blade!

Who-

who knew this kid had this many tricks up his sleeve...

Today, you must die!

Sorry,

your wish might not be fulfilled.

Today's ambush attempt,

Xiao Yan will remember deeply.

In the future,

I will definitely repay you.
