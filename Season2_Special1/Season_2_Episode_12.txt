There is a kind of flame
born deep underground.
Tempered by the earth's fire countless times,
fused,
compressed,
carved.
It takes ten years to form a spirit,
a hundred years to take shape,
and a thousand years to become a lotus.
Once completely formed,
the lotus's core gives rise to a cluster of green flame;
its name,
Green Lotus Core Flame.
The passageway was permeated with extremely strong fire type energy.
Under the guidance of Qing Lin's perception,
everyone pressed forward.
After descending for an unknown number of hours,
the remaining mercenaries were unable to endure the high temperature
and helplessly chose to withdraw.
Heavenly Flame.
Is it really up ahead?
Who knew
that Rock Desert City's underground
actually hid such a frightening place.
Yea.
What a spectacular subterranean magma world.
There's no more path ahead.
Also,
I practice a wood type Qi Method,
which happens to be restrained by fire type energy.
This place
is already my limit.
This little girl,
there really is something strange about her.
I'll head in and take a look.
Entering that magma?
Don't tell me you want to swim over?
This is-
Obviously I can't swim over.
Dou Qi wings?
You've really reached the Dou Wang level?
How is it possible?
Big Brother,
believe me,
I'll be fine.
Let me give it a try.
Be careful,
if there's anything unexpected, leave immediately!
No matter how terrifying it is inside,
I must go and take a look!
Young Master,
something is following you!
Quickly come back!
Young Master, watch out!
It's behind you!
Exploding Steps!
What a strange creature,
just what kind of Magical Beast is it?
Xiao Yan!
Little-
Little Yan...
This feeling
is so unfamiliar...
Little fellow,
finally unable to hold up any longer?
Teacher,
I thought you'd fallen asleep!
Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent.
It relies on devouring magma to survive.
Its evolution potential is extremely great;
with enough luck,
it may be able to evolve into a Rank 6 Magical Beast, comparable to Dou Huang.
Looks like this place really does have signs of Heavenly Flame.
This is-
What level of battle is this?
This fellow is about to get serious.
This fellow,
just what is he doing?
Company Leader,
Young Master, he
is still alive!
Not bad. // missing chinese subtitle 还不赖嘛
Could it be- // missing chinese subtitle 难道
Cunning beast!
Let's go, Qing Lin!
Don't come over!
You beast!
Damn it.
How are you?
It's nothing serious.
I'll be fine after resting a bit.
Later,
you should bring Qing Lin back.
I'm going to stay here and continue searching.
Right now, that beast
will only run if it sees me.
There already isn't anything here that can harm me.
This zone's area is so large,
trying to find Heavenly Flame here
won't be an easy task.
Young Master,
Qing Lin might be able to figure out where the Heavenly Flame is.
Come out!
Young Master, don't hit it.
It won't attack us anymore.
What's going on?
I'm not too sure myself.
It seems that
I've formed a kind of strange bond with it
and can sense its thoughts.
How incredible, little fellow.
Why is it that the people you meet are all so unusual?
Last time was the Woeful Poison Body;
this time isn't inferior,
actually meeting a little girl possessing Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils.
Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils?
How do I put it...
This kind of strange pupils
seems to only occur in the offspring of humans and Snake People;
it can basically be said to be the nemesis of all snake-form Magical Beasts.
Obviously,
this Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent in front of you got unlucky;
it was forced by this little girl's Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils to sign a contract.
Young Master,
it says, the Heavenly Flame is down below.
So that's how it is!
No wonder I was unable to detect the Heavenly Flame,
turns out it was covered by this crypt's magma.
Teacher,
here,
it's possible to go down?
Trying to obtain a Heavenly Flame,
naturally, it won't be that easy.
How about it,
dare jump in? // do you dare jump in
Little fellow,
hurry up.
I can use the Bone Chilling Flame to protect you for now,
however,
it depletes large amounts of Spiritual Strength.
If I were to lose my maintenance of Spiritual Strength,
you would be instantly burnt to ashes by the magma.
Heavenly Flame,
wait for me!
Qing Lin,
we should believe in him.
Xiao Yan really gives us too many surprises.
Since he can go down,
he can definitely return safely.
Little fellow,
within an hour,
you must return.
What?
What's wrong?
Take a look now at the surrounding magma.
Just what is going on here?
The temperature of the surrounding magma now
is already about to exceed the limit I can endure.
No way,
isn't the Bone Chilling Flame
ranked eleventh on the Heavenly Flame Ranking?
Could it be that the Heavenly Flame down there
is even more fierce than Teacher's?
I am currently in spirit state, after all,
so I can't exert much of the Bone Chilling Flame's strength.
Adding to that the surrounding environment,
an hour is already my limit.
Alright, hurry up.
Just how much further are you going to dive?
Half an incense stick,
if I still can't find the Heavenly Flame in half an incense stick's time,
I won't search anymore!
Fucking hell,
I'm going back,
no more searching!
Been tricked by this beast!
Green Lotus Core Flame...
Teacher,
we found it?
Unexpectedly, we really did find a Heavenly Flame.
Let's go take a look!
I will increase the strength of protection.
Although the Green Lotus Core Flame
is only nineteenth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking,
for the current you
it is actually the most suitable ranking.
Several years of effort have finally resulted in a reward.
Looking at the shape of this green lotus,
it has clearly already experienced thousands of years.
It should have already agglomerated the Green Lotus Core Flame.
How can it be?
How can it be gone?
Based on the shape of this green lotus,
the Green Lotus Core Flame should've been born long ago!
How
How can it be gone?!
Quiet,
you'd better calm down!
If it's not here,
then we just have to keep looking!
The Dou Qi Continent is so vast,
it's not like only this place has a Heavenly Flame.
But- but I spent such great effort,
am I really
just going to end up returning empty-handed?
Being able to come this far
is already very admirable.
In this world,
everyday, there are thousands of people
relentlessly struggling to achieve their own goals.
But once they have sacrificed everything
and yet fail to see hope,
they still choose to not give up.
Destiny will not always shelter you,
nor will it always neglect you.
When it closes one of your doors,
it will also open a new window for you.
Only by learning to let go,
you'll realize someday,
can you become carefree. // 才可能月朗风清 how2translate??
Yes, Teacher.
Any constraint
always originates from one's own heart.
I think
it's about time for a new beginning.
What is that?
This is
Seven-Colored Snake Scale.
Seven-Colored Snake Scale?
I was wondering why the Green Lotus Core Flame isn't in the lotus.
Turns out someone beat us to the punch.
Seven-Colored Snake Scale,
only one person in the entire Tager Desert possesses it.
That is, of course, the Snake People's
Queen Medusa.
Look like
we should really pay a visit
to the inner part of the Tager Desert.
