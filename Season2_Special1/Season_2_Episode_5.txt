An oppressive cloud looming over the people of Qingshan Town
had finally dissipated.
The Wolf Head Mercenary Company
was completely defeated.
At the crack of dawn,
like a beautiful dream,
a blue eagle carried Little Fairy Doctor and Xiao Yan
and headed towards a mystical place:
Medicine Valley.
Careful.
Student,
the energy in this valley is pure,
which will greatly aid you in breaking through to a Dou Shi.
Yes, Teacher!
Do you like it here?
Of course,
it's quiet and secluded,
with hardly any traces of other people.
How were you able to find this place?
If it wasn't for Little Lan accidentally barging in one time,
I probably couldn't have found this strange place.
No wonder.
En.
How about staying here for a while?
Some of the herbs required by the Rainbow Poison Book
can only be found here.
Sure,
this isn't a place you could easily come across.
You'll practice your medicine,
I'll work on my training,
so it's decided.
En!
Let's live here for the time being.
It's a bit shabby,
are you okay with that?
With you as a companion,
I'd be okay sleeping anywhere!
Pure nonsense.
Little Fairy Doctor!
En!
Xiao Yan,
Little Fairy Doctor?
Look at you,
sweating so much!
Why don't you wipe it off?
En.
Crude.
Xiao Yan,
let's eat some food!
Okay!
Smells delicious!
Well then, don't mind if I dig in!
Little Fairy Doctor,
you're an amazing cook!
Whoever gets to marry you,
will be a very lucky person indeed!
What a fool.
Little Fairy Doctor,
you-
what's wrong?
I reckon I just got tired from picking herbs,
it's nothing serious.
See,
I'm fine!
Are you sure?
I really am fine.
If you don't believe me, look!
I forgot,
I'm still missing a Monster Core.
I need to quickly leave the valley
and obtain it before it gets dark.
You-
Don't worry!
I'll come back real soon!
Will you be alright going alone?
I'll be fine!
Hey,
are you sure we can catch a Rank 2 Ice-type Magical Beast here?
What are you "hey"-ing for?
So disrespectful.
With Little Fairy Doctor around,
you've even forgotten how to call Teacher!
Yes, Teacher.
That's more like it.
See, this area is where Ice-type Magical Beasts are typically active.
As for whether or not a Rank 2 beast can be found,
that'll just depend on your luck.
It ain't easy getting Cores from these kinds of Magical Beasts.
Ling Er, are you alright?
Ever since Ka Gang and I confronted Gan Mu back then,
my strength still hasn't completely recovered.
Fighting Magical Beasts now,
I really feel quite powerless.
It's okay,
I'm here for you.
En.
This-
Not good!
Qing Ye!
Miss Ye!
Why would a Rank 2 Ice-type Magical Beast appear here?
Qing Ye,
are you okay?
Exploding Steps!
Octane Blast!
Xiao Yan!
It's you guys?
Looks like we meet again.
Sure enough, it's him!
Xiao Yan,
good thing you got here in time.
That was a close call!
Indeed!
Today we have received Brother Xiao's help yet again,
righteous, righteous!
Oh, right,
Brother Xiao, this is Qing Ye!
Miss Ye,
this is the person I've told you about,
young hero Xiao Yan.
Last time when we were chased by Gan Mu, it was thanks to his help we escaped.
So you are the young hero Xiao Yan,
it's an honor to meet you.
It wasn't much trouble,
no need to be so polite.
Brother Xiao,
why have you come to this place?
I'm trying to find a Rank 2 Monster Core.
After tracking it for so long,
it's a shame,
attacking this one was a waste.
But it's just as well,
I coincidentally got to help you guys.
Are you in great need of a Rank 2 Monster Core?
En,
yes.
Here.
This is an Ice-type Magical Beast's Monster Core.
Take it with you.
It really is a Rank 2 Monster Core.
You not only saved the lives of Ling Er and the rest of us,
but also killed Mu She.
Words alone cannot express our gratitude,
please be sure to accept it.
If that's the case,
thank you.
Little Fairy Doctor,
I finally obtained a Rank 2 Monster Core!
As soon as I find other herbs for the Icy Heart Pill and Path Protecting Pill,
I'll be able to...
Little Fairy Doctor!
Don't go there!
What happened?
Looking at the child's present situation,
she likely possesses a special constitution that's rarely seen in a century,
the Woeful Poison Body.
What's that?
Woeful Poison Body?
Such people rely on consuming poison to continuously increase their strength,
but when the day comes that their body can no longer suppress the poison Dou Qi,
they will suffer from thousands of poisons corroding their body
and die a slow, torturous death.
Could it be that her fainting last time was a precursor?
Teacher,
can't this condition be cured?
Very difficult.
Xiao Yan,
you- finally came back.
When I fainted,
did you touch me?
I didn't.
Little Fairy Doctor,
think about it,
this Woeful Poison Body of yours,
if I were to touch it
I'd be dead, right?
How could I be sitting here and talking to you then?
Don't fret.
I'll take good care of you.
I'll definitely think of a way
to completely resolve your Woeful Poison Body.
Do you believe me?
En.
Xiao Yan,
can I ask you about something?
What is it,
go ahead and ask.
I want to travel around the Dou Qi Continent,
would you like to come with me?
Are you joking?
How can you travel around with your condition?
I've already decided,
once I've collected all the ingredients I need,
I'll bring you with me and head out.
Are you surprised?
I, Xiao Yan, always do what I say.
Your illness will definitely be cured!
En.
Rest up well,
I'll go pick herbs for you.
You aren't properly resting,
what are you getting up to do?
I'm all better now,
I just can't wait to travel the world with you!
That's right,
were you able to find the medicinal ingredients you need?
I've found them,
but it's not enough.
Tomorrow, I'll pick another batch,
and then, let's leave this place together.
Really?
That's fantastic!
Could you accompany me outside to get some fresh air?
En.
Don't move.
Wow.
It's a pity,
beautiful things are always fleeting.
If we could always be like this together,
how wonderful that'd be.
Don't worry,
while your Woeful Poison Body isn't cured yet
I won't abandon you.
It's raining.
Shall we go back?
Let's stay a bit longer,
just a bit.
En.
Always be careful,
make sure to take care of yourself.
Huh?
I mean,
when you're fighting Magical Beasts and looking for herbs.
That's small stuff,
no need to worry about me.
En.
Falling asleep so quickly?
Little Fairy Doctor?
I found all the medicinal ingredients I need,
let's head out!
Little Fairy Doctor,
Little Fairy-
"Xiao Yan, I've left. Don't look for me. You need to train hard. Next time we meet, don't tell me you still haven't broken through to a Dou Shi, okay? As for me, I also have many unfinished things that I need to realize, one by one. Meeting you has been my life's greatest fortune. May we be destined to see each other again. -Little Fairy Doctor"
Xiao Yan,
I've left.
Don't look for me.
You need to train hard.
Don't let my illness
delay your big goals.
As for me,
I also have many unfinished things
that I need to realize, one by one.
Meeting you,
even if it's just this brief encounter,
is like a dream come true.
Let's meet again, fate willing.
Now, we gaze at the same moon but cannot hear each other's voice,
I wish to flow with the moonlight and shine down upon you.

Little Fairy Doctor!
From ancient times till now, no one has ever been able to cure the Woeful Poison Body.
I am a fool.
She just didn't want you to waste time for her sake,
what a good girl...
Little Fairy Doctor,
one day,
I, Xiao Yan
will definitely cure you!
