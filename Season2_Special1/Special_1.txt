Episode 1: Unexpected Encounter
According to legend, in the depths of the Magical Beast Mountain Range,
there exists a precious item that can raise one's fighting strength in a short period of time.
Countless practitioners,
putting aside all risks,
have ventured into the mountain range.
But they all entered without coming back,
giving up their lives in vain.
However, people are still ever obsessed with this item,
the Purple Spirit Crystal.
Aaaahh!
Teacher, please come out!
I can't stand it any longer!
You really don't know when to stop, huh?
Looks like I have no choice but to take out some real skills!
Look out!
Come out!
Come out quickly, you old fellow!
Making me be in such a dangerous place,
how can I possibly pick herbs in peace?
En, ha ha ha.
Xiao Yan,
practicing alchemy,
is something you shouldn't fall behind in.
These inner parts of the Magical Beast Mountain Range
are so rich with medicinal herbs...
This way, I don't have to personally refine pills for you every time.
Answer my question!
Any random thing here could kill me with a slap!
Are you messing with me?!
Those magical beasts outside aren't challenging enough,
venturing deeper will do you some good!
Just like this Rank 3 Earth affinity Rock Ape.
Fuck! // 我靠
Teacher,
just how long are we going to stay here for?
What,
are you scared?
Didn't you even dare to fight with a Dou Shi?
Go ahead and use your Flame Splitting Tsunami again,
go on, use it!
Alright,
Teacher, I was wrong,
last time I only wanted to test the power of a Di Rank Dou Technique...
Ha,
Calling that thing you used a Di Rank Dou Technique,
my ass!
*cough*
I'm going to have to duke it out with you today!
The hell,
even on its face? // [居然长脸上] idk how to translate this sorry, is something growing on its face...?
Aahh!
Teacher,
save me!
What a turbulent aura...
Mm.
What a tur-boob-lent aura indeed... // alt: tempestuous/tem"breast"uous??
Rank 6 Magical Beast, Amethyst Winged Lion King?
Who would actually try to target it?
Rank 6 Magical Beast,
that's on par with a Dou Huang level practitioner...
What,
are you feeling shocked?
Those fights I got into in the past,
could only be considered child's play...
Heh heh,
I've already said, the Dou Qi Continent is vast;
there are many people who are even stronger than Dou Huangs.
Once you reach that level in the future, you'll naturally discover
that this world is a very exciting one.
I truly am shocked by the sheer power of their fight;
however,
I won't be overly ambitious.
This road,
is something I must firmly tread on, one step at a time.
Human woman,
why do you disturb this King's rest?
Today, I do not come with ill intent.
I would simply like to borrow the Lion King's Purple Spirit Crystal.
Purple Spirit Crystal?
This Amethyst Winged Lion King can only shed a small piece once every twenty years.
Who are you to just ask for it?
I can exchange it for something you need.
Exchange?
Fine,
I happen to have recently entered a body transformation stage.
If you are able to hand me a Body Transformation Pill,
I will give a Purple Spirit Crystal.
How's this?
So this is the legendary Amethyst Winged Lion King?
Magical Beasts who have reached this rank,
have long already begun to possess consciousness,
and their intelligence would not lose to that of humans.
Looks like this is an opportunity
for you to witness a fight between truly strong beings.
Compared to those things you have,
I am actually more interested in you.
Could it be-
Dirty brat,
what are you thinking?
Eating high level human practitioners is a way for the Amethyst Winged Lion King to quickly raise its own rank.
That fellow is obviously not going to let that woman leave without trouble.
I know that you are also a Dou Huang.
But when it comes to an actual fight,
you may not be able to leave the Magical Beast Mountain Range alive!
Lion King need not be concerned about this.
What a terrifying battle!
Just the aftershocks of their fight
might easily cause a Dou Shi or even Da Dou Shi to perish!
Teacher,
could I possibly refine that purple flame into a flame seed?
Oho?
You sure have some imagination.
Teacher!
Weren't you supposed to protect me?
Why'd you come out?
This kind of flame originates from within a Magical Beast,
it cannot compare to a Heavenly Flame;
moreover, it is harder to tame.
Ohh.
Ah- argh-
Magical Beasts who have the ability to live in the inner parts of the mountain range
are mostly Rank 3 or higher and have developed a basic consciousness.
Lower rank beasts would voluntarily flee to the outer parts of the battlefield.
Those three are Rank 5 beasts, comparable to human Dou Wangs.
They clearly understand:
whoever chooses to help,
would actually insult the dignity of the eastern mountain region's king.
It's only the Magical Beast Mountain Range's eastern region,
but this kind of frightening lineup could easily wipe out an army.
Gale Pushing Force!
Human woman,
You are wearing out my limited patience!
As long as Lion King is willing to exchange the Purple Spirit Crystal,
I will definitely not bother you in the future.
Another serious bout is coming.
It's actually a sealing technique?
That woman
is in for some deep trouble.
Amethyst Seal!
Wind's Peak, Killer Meteor! //iffy translation
Scour the area!
That human woman must be found!
Urgh. Teacher!
Aaaaaaaah!
Man, that was so exciting,
that woman's last attack was super strong;
if the Amethyst Winged Lion King hadn't dodged in time,
its head likely would've been pierced through...
Heh,
besides the Purple Spirit Crystal,
the Lion King has something even rarer.
What is it?
Every time the Lion King produces a baby,
there is a very small chance that it will also produce a precious item,
Amethyst Birth Essence.
Later let's try our luck,
and see if we can find this thing.
If I save her,
it'd provoke the attention of Magical Beasts nearby,
but if I don't save her...
then-
Teacher,
Teacher?
Consider this your good luck.
Ah,
Ahh!
You- you woke up?
I-I-I just just wanted to help tend to your wounds,
no bad intentions...
Uh- oh, ohh,
of course, you were just unconscious
so I was going to apply medicine,
but since you're awake now,
you can do it yourself
heh heh...
Ugh,
I personally witnessed that woman's overbearing strength,
if she were to suddenly go into a fit of rage,
she could randomly kill me with a slap,
that'd be an unjust death!
Damned creature,
I was actually struck with its seal... // alt: by its sealing technique
Hey,
how about you help me apply medicine.
Me?
I can help you,
but let's make things clear,
afterwards, please don't do something stupid like gouging out my eyes because I saw your body...
Hmph, I'm not that much of a stickler,
as long as you properly control your hands and mouth.
What tough inner armor,
if this thing wasn't protecting her body,
that attack by the Amethyst Winged Lion King
would probably have directly ripped apart her upper half.
Ahem. Um...
the wound seems to be under your inner armor.
To stanch the bleeding,
I'm afraid...
Take it off.
Sorry to trouble.
Oh.
Manage your hands and eyes properly!
I am going to
clean your wounds now.
Hang in there.
I'll try my best to be gentle.
Alright.
The wound dressing is done.
You'll have to deal with the remaining internal injuries yourself.
Thank you.
Has she not been found yet?
Before daybreak,
if there still isn't news about that human woman,
this place will be your deathbed!
Such a valuable high level medicinal ingredient,
how could I possibly let her off just like that?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Having that woman by your side is a big source of trouble.
Are you really planning to keep doing this?
What can I do?
Her current condition is as such...
The way I see it, you might want to take advantage of her weak state to...
`ah ah', hm? //old: you know?
You might even gain the protection of a Dou Huang practitioner,
so that in the future,
you can walk freely in the Jia Ma Empire.
Indecent old man,
then after she fully recovers,
the first person she'd kill would be me.
Are you feeling better?
After two nights of healing,
my external injuries are no longer serious.
However, the seal on my body,
would require at least a few days to undo.
Just hide here for the time being then,
they shouldn't be able to discover this place.
You've got some guts,
with just the strength of a Dou Zhe,
charging into the inner parts of the Magical Beast Mountain Range.
Didn't have a choice,
was chased in by people trying to kill me.
Oh yea,
what's your name?
Yun Zhi.
I'm-
Xiao Yan,
this world is dangerous,
don't expose your real identity.
Yao Yan.
Mmm.
Here.
Eat up.
After you undo the seal,
are you still planning to confront the Amethyst Winged Lion King?
I have to obtain the Purple Spirit Crystal.
Taking such a big risk, is it worth it?
To raise one's strength in a short period of time, right?
This is why so many people want to obtain it.
However, I have a more important use for it.
My power level is not too different from the Lion King's.
It is just that I did not expect it to be capable of a sealing technique.
Next we fight,
my Wind's Peak, Killer Meteor may not lose to it.
That move is indeed very strong.
No worries,
I can help you.
Why?
We're friends, right?
Friends?
How could we be discovered?
Everyday I make sure to cover my body in powder to hide my scent,
Magical Beasts can't possibly tail me here...
Don't tell me,
you went outside today?
I,
did go out to take a bath today...
Stay here and don't move.
I'm going out to lure away those Magical Beasts.
Your strength...
let me go instead.
You'd better stay here and not make a move!
If you went outside, it'd only attract even more beasts.
Then we'd all die here!
Such a young age,
to think he'd be this merciless when he's angry.
Since you like to act so brave,
go ahead and leave by yourself.

[Episode 2]
In the days before Yun Zhi was able to undo the seal,
due to Xiao Yan's attentive care,
the pair's relationship gradually became closer.
Perhaps it was because of the seal,
in Yun Zhi's conversations with Xiao Yan,
her air of high-standing nobility also gradually weakened.
However, due to Yun Zhi's mistake,
Xiao Yan's whereabouts had been exposed.
Flame Blowing Palm!
Yao Yan,
are you alright?
Miss,
please don't go outside anymore.
If another Magical Beast were to come, I would really
end up dead...
Deliberately trying to choke me to death, huh?
Are you okay now?
Nothing too bad, yea.
Fortunately they were just two low level Magical Beasts.
If they had been Rank 3 beasts...
I probably wouldn't be able to return.
My apologies.
I didn't think that I would cause these problems to arise.
Forget it, it was also my fault for not clarifying things with you earlier.
Now, you are the sick person.
This time, let me take care of you.
You can grill fish?
Nobody has ever tried my grilled fish, you know.
Little fellow, even looking down on me?
Seasoning... should be this one, right?
This is... your grilled fish?
This is the first time I've made food myself.
Even if it tastes bad, you have to finish it!
Or else, once I recover...
Miss, I'm a sick person,
yet you're trying to poison me...
I am immune to all poisons! Immune to all poisons!
Um,
Yao Yan,
do you also feel a little weird?
You- show me what you used to season the fish
What is it,
is there something wrong with this seasoning?
Back then I shouldn't have picked up that thing again...
Just what is this?
This-
is something I accidentally formulated,
an aphrodisiac.
Aphrodisiac?
Learning wrong things at such a young age,
just what is that unscrupulous teacher of yours teaching you?
Damned old fellow!
I can't stay here. I need to leave!
Wait- outside-
Miss, please calm down,
there are some Magical Beasts interested in human females,
such as that Co-Ape...
My first kiss has been taken...
Yao Yan,
you-
if you dare do that to me,
once I recover,
I must kill you.
If I lose my body,
I will first kill you,
and then kill myself.
Teacher, stop playing dead,
how do I get rid of this damned thing's effect?
Hee hee,
this is but an excellent opportunity.
This woman likely enjoys a high status in the Jia Ma Empire,
if you were to...
Stop fooling around.
Yun Zhi isn't the type of girl to just follow whoever takes her body.
*sigh*
Gather your Dou Qi in your palms,
then massage the acupuncture points below the neck, on the lower abdomen and thighs.
I've wronged you.
Yun Zhi!
Let us pretend that the incident today never happened.
Otherwise, if news of it spreads, you will not gain any benefit.
A spring dream leaves no traces...
Ha ha ha ha!
Your seal hasn't been resolved yet!
Human woman,
you weren't easy to find.
Today, you have nowhere to run!
That depends on whether or not you have the ability!
Little fellow, your sense of direction isn't bad, huh?
While the Amethyst Winged Lion King is chasing Yun Zhi,
let's go to its hideout to look for the Amethyst Birth Essence.
Then I can address one of Master's wishes.
Let's be real,
what you actually want to do is obtain the Purple Spirit Crystal for that girl, right?
If I'm not wrong, haven't you both reached a point of no reconciliation?
Aiya, I don't understand.
I really don't understand you youngsters.
That move is indeed very strong.
No worries,
I can help you.
Why?
We're friends, right?
Friends?
Once you get close to the Purple Spirit Crystal, this will become hot.
I'll try my best to divert the Magical Beasts away.
Find an opportune time to sneak into the Amethyst Winged Lion King's hideout.
Is that the Purple Spirit Crystal?
This... could it be the Amethyst Birth Essence?
Back then I barged into eight different Amethyst Winged Lion King caves,
but I was never able to find it.
Who knew,
you would actually be able to find this thing!
The Amethyst Birth Essence contains an extremely substantial amount of energy.
Once a Rank 4 Amethyst Winged Lion cub swallows it,
it will be able to directly advance to Rank 5.
Fuck, it's that amazing?
Heh heh,
this cub is only Rank 3,
plus, the Purple Spirit Crystal must be inside.
Purple Smoke Fruit?
Ha, kid,
you even know that Fire affinity beasts love this thing?
Are you trying to use poison?
Amethyst Winged Lions have strong immunity, you know.
With your level of preparation skill,
can you successfully poison it?
Who said this is poison?
This is my specially formulated powerful laxative!
Strong immunity my ass, hehe!
This- how do I snatch this?
Indeed,
brute force alone
won't be able to break this thing.
To open it,
heh heh heh...
Purple Spirit Crystal?
Quick, quick!
Use jade bottles to catch it!
This is the Amethyst Birth Essence!
You can't directly consume it like that,
your body won't be able to stand it!
Wasting it would be a shame!
I forgot to tell you,
because an Amethyst Winged Lion cub is born together with the Amethyst Birth Essence,
it can sense everything that happens to the Amethyst Birth Essence.
Yo-ho? This move again?
Teacher, don't be noisy,
that Magical Beast is at the peak of Rank 3,
I certainly don't want to subject myself to abuse.
What is up with this speed?
Could it be the Amethyst Birth Essence I ingested?
Fuck, all I did was lick a few times,
does it really need to release this much energy?
You beast,
Yun Zhi is currently in great need of the Purple Spirit Crystal,
I can't waste any more time with you!
Am I going to
be buried here today...
Human woman,
your enemy is me!
Given your current condition,
getting distracted is not a wise choice!
Yun Zhi...
Now, you are the sick person.
This time, let me take care of you.
You can grill fish?
This is the first time I've made food myself.
Even if it tastes bad, you have to finish it!
Flame Splitting
Tsunami!
Wind's Peak,
Killer Meteor.
Gone already?
She actually left behind a close-fitting thing...
It's better she goes back to being that highly respected Dou Huang.
Thank you.
Perhaps your meaning when you said "friend"
is not the same as the world's.
Training alone for so many years,
how could I have imagined, that towards a young boy...
may we meet again if fate wills it,
little fellow.
Teacher,
I seem to have advanced two levels,
it looks like... I'm a nine star Dou Zhe now?
Kiddo,
when that woman was about to leave, she even pecked you on the head!
Really?
Joking.
I believe it!
Indecent old man...
